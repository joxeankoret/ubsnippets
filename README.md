# What is this repository for?

This is a set of Undefined Behaviour C/C++ Snippets. It's, for now, a chaotic and really incomplete set of C/C++ snippets showing undefined behaviour without proper classification or explanations. Feel free to send pull requests making it more understandable or simply adding more.

# Undefined Behaviour Snippets

## Division By Zero

```
int x = 1;
return x / 0; // undefined behavior
```

## Accessing an array out of bounds

```
int arr[4] = {0, 1, 2, 3};
int *p = arr + 5;  // undefined behavior
```
## Modifying an object between two sequence points

Modifying an object between two sequence points more than once produces undefined behavior. It is worth mentioning that there are considerable changes in what causes undefined behavior in relation to sequence points as of C++11. The following example will however cause undefined behavior in both C++ and C.

Example 1:
```
i = i++ + 1; // undefined behavior
```

Example 2:
```
a[i] = i++; // undefined behavior
printf("%d %d\n", ++n, power(2, n)); // also undefined behavior
```

## Integer overflows

Simple example:
```
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
  printf ("%d\n", (INT_MAX+1) < 0);
  return 0;
}
```

Real world example:
```
int64_t V = IV->getSExtValue();
if (V >= 0)
  Record.push_back(V << 1);
else
  Record.push_back((-V << 1) | 1);  <<----- bad line

```

The previous code causes this error:
```
UNDEFINED at <BitcodeWriter.cpp, (740:29)> :
Operator: -
Reason: Signed Subtraction Overflow
left (int64): 0
right (int64): -9223372036854775808
```

In all modern C/C++ variants running on twoâ€™s complement machines, negating an int whose value is INT_MIN (or in this case, INT64_MIN) is undefined behavior. The fix is to add an explicit check for this case.
